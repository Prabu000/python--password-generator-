# Password Generator

## Description
This Python script generates a random password of a specified length, containing a mix of:
- Uppercase and lowercase letters
- Digits
- Special characters

The password length must be at least 4 characters, and it combines all allowed characters randomly to form a strong password.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are required (uses Python's built-in `random` and `string` modules).

## How to Use
1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script. For example, if the file is saved as `password_generator.py` on your Desktop, use:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
```

4. Run the script with the following command:

```bash
python password_generator.py
```

5. The script will prompt you to enter the desired password length. After entering a valid length (at least 4), it will generate and display a random password.

## Example

```bash
Enter the desired password length: 12
Generated password: A1@b3V#kWz9Lp
```
